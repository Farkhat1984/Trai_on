# Sound Files for Trai_on

This directory should contain the following sound files:

## Required Files:

1. **click.wav** - A pleasant, short button click sound (around 100-200ms)
   - Should be a soft, modern UI click sound
   - Example: A gentle "tap" or "pop" sound
   - Recommended: Use a free sound from freesound.org or similar

2. **whoosh.wav** - A long, decreasing whoosh sound for flying animations (around 800-1200ms)
   - Should start with a swoosh and gradually fade out
   - Syncs with the flying animation duration
   - Example: A "whoosh" or "swipe" sound that trails off
   - Recommended: Use a free sound from freesound.org or similar

## Temporary Solution:

If sound files are not immediately available, the app will work without sounds.
The SoundService handles missing files gracefully and continues operation.

## How to Add Sounds:

1. Download or create the sound files
2. Place them in this directory (assets/sounds/)
3. Ensure they are named exactly as: click.mp3 and whoosh.mp3
4. Run `flutter pub get` to refresh assets
5. Rebuild the app
